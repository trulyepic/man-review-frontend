        📊 How Rankings Work
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Toon Ranks is powered by the votes of our community. Every ranking is
        calculated from user-submitted scores across five core categories:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-gray-800">
        <li>
          <strong>Story</strong> – How strong, compelling, or original is the
          plot?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Characters</strong> – Are the characters well-developed and
          memorable?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>World Building</strong> – How immersive and consistent is the
          setting?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Art</strong> – How impressive is the visual or artistic style?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drama / Fighting</strong> – How impactful are emotional scenes
          or action sequences?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">
        🔢 How Scores Are Calculated
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>User votes are collected for each category.</li>
        <li>Each category score is averaged:</li>
        <li className="pl-4 text-sm italic text-gray-600">
          Average = Total Score / Number of Votes
        </li>
        <li>We compute the final score by averaging the 5 category scores:</li>
        <li className="pl-4 text-sm italic text-gray-600">
          Final Score = (Story + Characters + World Building + Art + Drama) / 5
        </li>
        <li>
          Series are ranked by highest final score. Series without enough data
          are marked "Unranked."
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mt-6 text-gray-700">
        ✅ Each user can only vote once per category per series, ensuring fair
        and balanced results.
